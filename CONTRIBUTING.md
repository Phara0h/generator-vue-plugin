See the [contributing docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md)

Note: We are regularly asked whether we can add or take away features. If a change is good enough to have a positive impact on all users, we are happy to consider it.

If not, `generator-vue-plugin` is fork-friendly and you can always maintain a custom version which you `npm install && npm link` to continue using via `yo vue-plugin` or a name of your choosing.

## Support Questions

We frequently get issues where people *modified* something after they finished scaffolding and things weren't working properly. These are classified as **support** questions; they are related to this generator, but not something we did wrong. It's best to ask those on [Stack Overflow] with tags `#yeoman` and `#vue` instead of opening an issue here.

If the issue has already been opened before it turned out to be a support question, feel free to paste the link to the Stack Overflow question, so we can answer it.
